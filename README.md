# Hello! 🖐️😄

My name is **Kevin Yauwry**, and I’m currently an undergraduate student in my 5th semester, based in Surabaya, Indonesia.

With a passion for technology and a strong drive to continually expand my knowledge, I’m eager to tackle new challenges, 
especially in the ever-evolving tech landscape. My keen interests lie in front-end and back-end development as well as game development, 
where I enjoy crafting user-friendly interfaces, robust systems, and immersive experiences.\I would be thrilled to work with you and bring your ideas to life!

Feel free to reach out to me at [My Email](mailto:kevinyauwri01@gmail.com)! I'd love to hear from you! ❤️
